# Personal website

Here you can find the source code for my own personal website, built with Webpack, UIkit, SASS, Emscripten, TypeScript, and EJS.

## Building the website

Install the necessary development dependencies with:

```bash
npm install --include=dev
```

Then, you can build the website by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or for development:

```bash
npm run build-dev
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the built files. You can then serve this folder with any static file server.
